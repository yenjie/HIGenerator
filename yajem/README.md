YaJEM is based on the modified Fortran code of the PYSHOW algorithm of the PYTHIA 6 package. Download the YaJEM package from the link below, save in a subdirectory of your choice and unpack. The result should be a manual, two Fortran files yajem.f and pythia_yajem.f and a data file profile.dat. Please refer to the manual for further instructions.
